These are just some nice and small gedit plug-ins.

GEDITTOOLS:
This is the major plugin. It comes along with 
- XML Highlighting, 
- Search Result Counting and 
- A Launcher For Diff Compare Tool "Meld"
- Automatic Selection Highlighting.
See README in ./gedittools for further details

SORTDOCUMENT:
A small plugin to sort a document alphabetically. No major stuff :-)

Have fun!
